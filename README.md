## Dependencies
You can use any system as long as you have the **PLASMA DESKTOP ENVIRONMENT** on it. As well as you also have the following to have the same configuration as me. 


| Name | Description | Why is it needed? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [`Global Menu Libraries`](https://github.com/The-Sensual-Dotfiles/Libreries-Global-Menu-KDE) |  Libraries to adapt the global menu to programs and have a better experience  | Some programs do not come with these settings by default  |
| [`Window AppMenu Applet`](https://github.com/psifidotos/applet-window-appmenu) |My Latte Dock Layout uses it. 
| [`Latte Dock`](https://github.com/KDE/latte-dock) | Latte is a dock based on plasma frameworks that provides an elegant and intuitive experience for your tasks and plasmoids. | My "RICE" is all latte dock, specifically this version |
| [`SanFrancisco Fonts`](https://github.com/The-Sensual-Dotfiles/macOS-Fonts) | SF Pro. This sans-serif typeface is the system font for iOS, macOS, and tvOS | To make it look more like the system |
| [`Kvantum`](https://github.com/tsujan/Kvantum/blob/master/Kvantum/INSTALL.md) | Kvantum is an SVG-based theme engine for Qt, tuned to KDE and LXQt, with an emphasis on elegance, usability and practicality. | Window Decoration  |

I obligatorily recommend this version of [`Latte Dock`](https://github.com/KDE/latte-dock), as well as this [`Window AppMenu Applet`](https://github.com/psifidotos/applet-window-appmenu) for you. Since they have good features that can help you and have more configuration, any of these 2 versions is compiled, so if you are in ***ARCH LINUX you can install it with an [AUR HELPER](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/AUR_helpers)***, and in case you don't have that distro you will have to compile it, so I'll leave you my configuration for the flags for when I had to compile the program
